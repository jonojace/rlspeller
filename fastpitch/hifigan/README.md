# HiFi-GAN

Relevant code extracted from the [original implementation (jik876/hifi-gan)](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan)
for full compatibility, with some minor fixes from [my fork](https://github.com/dan-wells/hifi-gan).

With luck and the right config file, any model checkpoint trained from that
implementation should Just Work here.
